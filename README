# Development on MacOS

## Building development environment

Note that we use the root priviledge to install the packages below.

To prevent any issue from different versions of Ruby, use rbenv to manage the versions:

```
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then install ruby
```
rbenv install 3.2.3
rbenv local 3.2.3
(or rbenv global 3.2.3)
ruby -v
```

Next, install bundler
```
gem install bundler
```

Finally, 
```
git clone ... formlang_help
cd formlang_help
bundle install
```

## Local development 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Development on Windows 11

We use the windows linux subsystem for setting up the development
environment.

## Building development environment

Step 1: Install windows linux subsystem

Step 2: Install ubuntu (no password)


## Local development

We do not use the Linux file system for managing the project. Instead,
we use the Windows file system to do this job. However, we use the
Linux subsystem to run the local server. A minor issue of doing so is
that the local server will not detect the changes of the file content
automatically.
