            Form Flows: Crafting Personalized Form Experiences
        </h1>
    </div>

    <p class="bd-lead">
        FormLang's form flow feature empowers you to seamlessly
        combine multiple forms into a single, unified experience. This
        approach not only streamlines the form-filling process but
        also enables you to personalize the user journey by directing
        respondents to different forms based on their responses to
        previous questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Form Flows</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Streamlined Multi-Form Task</b>:
            Form flows reduce the need to manage individual forms separately, by combining multiple forms into a cohesive workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personalized User Experience</b>:
            By guiding respondents to different forms based on their previous responses,
            form flows provide a tailored experience that caters to their specific needs and preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Enhanced User Engagement</b>:
            By eliminating the need for respondents to navigate through multiple forms independently,
            form flows enhance user engagement and reduce the likelihood of form abandonment.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The form flow workspace provides a user-friendly interface for designing and managing your form flows.
        To access the workspace, go to Create a Form Flow in the {{ site.designApp }}.        
    </p>

        Form Flow Workspace

    {% assign figure_counter = figure_counter | plus: 1 %}

    <p>
        The form flow workspace resembles the form action
        workspace. In this workspace, you can easily drag and drop
        forms to create the desired flow, define conditional branching
        rules, and customize the overall user experience. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As shown in Figure {{ figure_counter }}, the workspace consists of the following key features:

            1. Toolbar
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The toolbar at the top of the workspace has buttons for opening/creating a form flow, saving the form action, and redoing/undoing recent operations.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            2. Form flow title
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The form flow title is displayed below the toolbar. Click the title to edit it.

            3. Node toolbox
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The left node toolbox provides five types of nodes: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Form node:</b> Represents a form.</li>
                <li><b>Evaluation node:</b>Evaluates the form responses based on the evaluation rules you define.</li>
                <li><b>Decision node:</b>Makes a decision based on the results of the evaluation.</li>
                <li><b>Custom event node</b>: Triggers a custom event.</li>
            </ul>

            To create a node, drag it from the toolbox and drop it on the canvas. For more information about node types, see ... (todo).
        </dd>
        <dt>
            4. Canvas
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The canvas is the main workspace where you create and edit your form flows.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            5. Property inspector
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The property inspector allows you to edit the properties of the selected edge or node in the canvas.

        Validating Form Flows
    </h3>

    <p>
        As a form action, a form flow is also represented as a
        flowchart. Compared with the form action, a form flow does not
        contain feedback node types.  The rules for validating form
        actions apply to form flows as well. For more information, please go to the link.
