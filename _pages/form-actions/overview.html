            Form Actions: Automate tasks based on responses
        </h1>
    </div>

    <P class="bd-lead">
        With form actions, you can automate assessing the form responses and performing other related tasks based on the assessment results.        
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, you can use the form actions to:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Calculate the total points for the responses based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Decide if a respondent passes a screening test or not based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Send different messages back to respondents based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Redirect the respondents to new forms based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Trigger your custom events and then send out notifications based on the subscriptions for the custom events.            
        </li>
    </ul>

        The form action workspace is a one-stop shop for creating and editing form actions. To access the workspace, go to Create a Form Action in the {{ site.designApp }}.        
    </p>

    <p>
        As shown in Figure {{ figure_counter }}, the workspace consists of the following key features:

            3. Node toolbox
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The left node toolbox provides five types of nodes: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Form node:</b> Represents a form.</li>
                <li><b>Evaluation node:</b>Evaluates the form responses based on the evaluation rules you define.</li>
                <li><b>Decision node:</b>Makes a decision based on the results of the evaluation.</li>
                <li><b>Feedback node:</b>Sends a message or a new form link to the user.</li>
                <li><b>Custom event node</b>: Triggers a custom event.</li>
            </ul>

            To create a node, drag it from the toolbox and drop it on the canvas. For more information about node types, see Form Action Nodes: link to documentation.
