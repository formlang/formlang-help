            Form Actions: Automate tasks based on responses
        </h1>
    </div>

    <p class="bd-lead">
        With form actions, you can automate assessing the form responses and performing other related tasks based on the assessment results.        
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, you can use the form actions to:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Calculate the total points for the responses based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Decide if a respondent passes a screening test or not based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Send different messages back to respondents based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Redirect the respondents to new forms based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Trigger your custom events and then send out notifications based on the subscriptions for the custom events.            
        </li>
    </ul>

        Validating Form Actions
    </h3>

    {% assign figure_counter = figure_counter | plus: 1 %}    
    
    <p>
        A form action is represented as a flowchart. To determine if your form action is valid, check its corresponding flowchart against the following rules:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Start with a Form Node:</b>
            The first node in a form action flowchart must always be a form node. This node represents the form that will be used to collect data from respondents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Valid Successors for Form Nodes:</b>
            Following a form node, there are three valid types of nodes that can be placed next: an evaluation node, a feedback node, or a custom event node.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Evaluation Node Successors:</b>
            The successor of an evaluation node must always be a decision node. An evaluation node assesses the form responses based on predefined rules, and the decision node determines the next step based on the evaluation results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Decision Node Successors:</b>
            A decision node can have multiple successors, representing the different paths the form action can take based on the evaluation results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Valid Successors for Decision Nodes:</b>
            The successors of a decision node must be either feedback nodes or custom event nodes. Feedback nodes provide responses to respondents, while custom event nodes trigger specific actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Outgoing Decision Edges:</b>
            Each edge originating from a decision node represents a separate branch following the evaluation node. To define the specific condition under which this branch will be executed, click the edge and edit its properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Leaf Nodes:</b>
            A feedback node is a leaf node, meaning it has no successors. This indicates that the feedback node represents the final step in the form action.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Custom Event Node Successors:</b>
            A custom event node can be a leaf node or have a feedback node as its successor. If a custom event node is followed by a feedback node, it provides additional information to the respondent.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>
        Example of a Valid Form Action
    </h5>

    <p>
        The figure below shows an example of a valid form action. In this case, the system evaluates the form response and, based on the evaluation result, sends one of two feedback messages to the respondent.

    <h3 id="evaluation-methods">
        Evaluation methods
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        You can choose one of the two evaluation methods for an evaluation node:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Weighted scoring:</b>
            Assigns a point value to each question, and the total
            score for the form response is calculated by adding up the
            points for all of the questions answered correctly. This
            method is useful for evaluating forms where the questions
            have different levels of difficulty or importance. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Logic evaluation:</b>
            Defines a set of logic statements, each of which assesses
            whether a specific condition based on the form response is
            true or false.  The overall result of the evaluation is
            determined by applying either the conjunctive (AND) or
            disjunctive (OR) operation to the individual logic
            statements. In other words, the form response is
            considered to be true only if all the logic statements
            evaluate to true (AND), or if at least one logic statement
            evaluates to true (OR).
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h5>Defining Evaluation Rules</h5>

    {% assign figure_counter = figure_counter | plus: 1 %}
    
    <p>
        To define evaluation rules, select the evaluation node in the
        canvas and then click the Edit button in the corresponding
        property inspector. This will open a dialog box, as shown in Figure {{ figure_counter }}, where you can
        select the evaluation method you want to use and then define the
        rules for that method.
    </p>

    <h5>
        Weighted Scoring Rules
    </h5>

    {% assign figure_counter = figure_counter | plus: 1 %}        

    <p>
        When you select weighted scoring, a dialog box, as shown in Figure {{ figure_counter }} opens where you
        can define the comparative operations and assign points for
        each question. The system will apply these rules to the
        selected questions and compute the total points for the form
        response.

    </h5>

    {% assign figure_counter = figure_counter | plus: 1 %}

    <p>
        When you select logic evaluation, a dialog box, as shown in
        Figure {{ figure_counter }}, opens where you can define the
        logic for evaluating the form response to be true or
        false. The system will apply this logic to the form response
        and determine whether it is true or false.
