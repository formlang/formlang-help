            Form Actions: Automate tasks based on responses
        </h1>
    </div>

    <P class="bd-lead">
        With form actions, you can automate assessing the form responses and performing other related tasks based on the assessment results.        
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, you can use the form actions to:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Calculate the total points for the responses based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Decide if a respondent passes a screening test or not based on the evaluation rules you define.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Send different messages back to respondents based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Redirect the respondents to new forms based on their responses.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Trigger your custom events and then send out notifications based on the subscriptions for the custom events.            
        </li>
    </ul>
