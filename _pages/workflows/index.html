        The workflow wizard is accessible through the Create a
        Workflow option in {{ site.designApp }}. It's a three-step
        process, as you'll see in Figure {{ figure_counter }} below.

        In the first step, you'll pick a publication to serve as the
        foundation for your workflow. Don't worry, your existing
        publication won't be affected! You can choose an existing
        publication for a form or form flow, or create a new one
        tailored to your needs and target audience.
        Figure {{ figure_counter }} shows a workflow with the chosen publication highlighted.

    <p>
        Take charge of your workflow's timing in step two! Schedule it
        for a single execution on a specific date and time, or set it
        to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly based on your needs. Want
        more control? Exclude specific dates from recurring schedules
        or define an end date. Plus, you can pause and resume your
        workflow anytime for ultimate flexibility.
