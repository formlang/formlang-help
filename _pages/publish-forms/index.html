            Control Form Access: Easily Publish Forms for Multiple Audiences            
        </h1>
    </div>

    <p class="bd-lead">
        With FormLang, you can seamlessly publish a single form to
        different audiences, catering to their specific needs and
        access control requirements. FormLang offers three distinct
        audience types, each with its own unique access control
        methods.        
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Everyone:</b>
            This option provides broad accessibility to the form,
            making it available to anyone who encounters it. No
            respondent information is tracked, ensuring
            privacy. However, you can still implement protective
            measures like setting a maximum number of responses or
            requiring a password for access.            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Maximum Responses:</b>
                    Once the specified response limit is reached, no further submissions will be accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Password Protection:</b>
                    Only individuals with the correct password can access the form.                    
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Visitors:</b>
            This audience type utilizes a preliminary form to gather
            respondent information before granting access to the main
            form. This approach is particularly useful when you need
            to collect specific respondent details and avoid
            repetitive data entry. You can safeguard the form using
            the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Maximum Responses:</b> Limit the total number of responses.</li>
                <li><b>Password Protection:</b> Restrict access to those who possess the password.</li>
                <li><b>Disabling New Visitors:</b> Prevent new visitors from accessing the form, restricting access to existing users.</li>
                <li><b>Verifying Respondent Information:</b>Validate respondent identities by requesting their email addresses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Organization Members:</b>
            This audience type restricts form access to authorized
            members within your organization. Access control is
            governed by granular attribute-based access control
            (ABAC), granting access exclusively to users who match the
            defined attributes. These attributes can encompass email
            addresses, roles, organizational units, and other relevant
            criteria.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        By carefully considering the target audience for your form,
        you can select the most appropriate publication method,
        ensuring that your form reaches the intended recipients while
        maintaining data privacy and security.
