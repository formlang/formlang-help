            To join your organization, please follow the general instructions below: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, the system will ask for your organization name. Please contact your administrator for the organization name.
                    (The system will remember your organization information in your browser.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, the system will ask for your personal information, including your name, email, and password.
                    Once you submit the personal information, you account will be created.
