        Additional tips
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Here are some tips for making the right changes to the system settings:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If you have a large number of employees, you may want to
            disable new user registration and require all new
            employees to be added to the system by an administrator.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to make sure that your employees' passwords
            are strong, you can increase the password complexity
            requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to add an extra layer of security to your
            {{ site.formLangBrand }} account, you can enable two-factor
            authentication.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        If you are unsure about how to make a particular change,
        please contact {{ site.formLangBrand}} support for assistance.
